# WordWalker

WordWalker takes a text passage and creates a field of letters in which the text describes a meandering path, boggle-style.

This was a hobby project to see if I could build a program that could generate such fields from an arbitrary block of text.

## Installation

At the moment, probubbly best to just clone this repository and use the included console.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/StandardGiraffe/word-walker.git
```

## Usage

Currently, the gem is limited to printing diagnostic output for demonstration purposes.  If you'd like to try it from the command line, enter the custom terminal:

```bash
$ bin/console
```

... and then run something like the following:

```ruby
passage = "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day? / Thou art more lovely and more temperate: / Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, / And summer's lease hath all too short a date:"

grids = WordWalker::Sequence.new(passage, passes: 5000)

grids.print_results(2)
```

The diagnostic output will display the top candidates (three by default), the top loser, and the failure rate of the builds (ie., how many builds worked their ways into dead-ends):

### Future development goals

- Output grid properties to JSON or YAML
- Read from a JSON or YAML file to rebuild the grid

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
